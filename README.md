# React
##### What is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible, free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.
<sub>Imperative code instructs JavaScript on how it should perform each step. With declarative code, we tell JavaScript what we want to be done, and let JavaScript take care of performing the steps.</sub>
